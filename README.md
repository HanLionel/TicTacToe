# Tic Tac Toe

## Installation

After cloning the repository, from the project root directory, run:

`npm install && npm run make`

Open up the browser, go to http://localhost:1050/tic-tac-toe or http://localhost:1050/tic-tac-toe/advanced and start playing!

http://localhost:1050/tic-tac-toe/advanced has a slightly more complex version that talks to the server to store information across page refreshes.
